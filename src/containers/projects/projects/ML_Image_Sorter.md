Solo developed a Deep Learning program capable of sorting images of different mitosis stages of cells.

Program based on Convolutional Networks.

This is a cell image sorter which categorizes pictures based on their mitosis stages

It was built in TensorFlow and Google Colabs. The model allows to be retrained on different image catgories not just cell mitosis.

The idea behind this project is to help medical cancer research identity cells that may be developing too quickly.
