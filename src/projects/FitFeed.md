FitFeed is a gym mobile app which allows users to track their workouts and share them online with other people (this is like Strava but tailored for the gym expierience).

It allows you to keep track of your own physique and track your friends and nag them if they are slacking off.

There are also weekly activity tracker boards to incentivize users to workout. It uses Firebase Storage to store user generated content such as workouts and images, Google Auth for sign-in and camera related libraries.

The app is made natively for android and ios in React Native.

The project is something I am currently working on, and the source code is available on GitHub.
