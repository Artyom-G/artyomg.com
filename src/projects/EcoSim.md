# Project Overview

Welcome to EcoSim, an ecological simulator designed to model the interactions and advancements of biological species as they grow together and form balanced populations. This project aims to provide insights into how species coexist and maintain ecological balance by simulating their behaviors and needs.


# Technologies Used

**Game Engine:** Used Unity to implement the core behavoural logic for the simulation with object oriented programming.

**Simulation Framework:** Implemented using a simulation framework or custom-built environment to model the behaviors of species.

**Randomly Generated 3D Terrain:** Used Perlin Noise multiplied together to achieve a randomly generated 3D terrain.

**Blender:** Used Blender for other 3D assets.

# Controls

**Movement**: WASD

**Vertical Movement**: EQ

**Faster Movement**: Shift

**Click on Entities**: This will make the camera follow them automatically


# Key Features

**Interactive Learning:** Offers an interactive platform for learning about predator-prey relationships, resource management, and population dynamics.

**Predator-Prey Dynamics:** Simulates the interactions between predators and prey, each with unique needs and behaviors.

**Behavioral Meters:** Each animal has its own hunger, thirst, and reproductive urge meters that influence their actions and interactions.

**Population Balance:** Models the natural checks and balances that occur in ecosystems, demonstrating how species populations stabilize over time.
