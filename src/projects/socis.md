<title>VP of Events - Society of Computing and Information Science (SOCIS) | Portfolio of Artyom Gabtraupov</title>

# Project Overview

As the **VP of Events** for the **Society of Computing and Information Science (SOCIS)** at the University of Guelph, I was responsible for leading the organization and execution of various events aimed at enhancing the student experience for **School of Computer Science** students. SOCIS serves as the official student society, promoting community engagement, organizing hackathons, and creating opportunities for students to network and innovate.

During my time in this role, I successfully led a team to manage multiple events, ranging from technical workshops to hackathons, while also playing a key role in revamping the SOCIS website to streamline event registration.

# Technologies Used

**Next.js**: For developing and redesigning the SOCIS website.  
**PostgreSQL**: Integrated for type-safe APIs to handle event registration and communication.  
**GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
