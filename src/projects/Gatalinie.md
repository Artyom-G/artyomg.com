<title>Custom Portfolio Website for a Clothing Designer</title>

# Project Overview

This is the website of the Gatalinie brand that I developed from scratch based on their wishes.

I made a custom portfolio website for a Kitchener-based clothing designer. This project involved implementation of modern web development practices to deliver a professional and responsive portfolio.

The website contributed to **$3,000 in revenue** within the first three months, thanks to the seamless integration of interactive features that engaged potential clients.


# Technologies Used

**React.js:** For building the interactive user interface.

**EmailJS:** API for managing emails
