# Project Overview

I led a team of students to develop an isometric tower defense game built in Unity. Welcome to Rats and Shells Tower Defense, a thrilling 2D top-down pixel isometric tower defense game that showcases my skills in game engines, object-oriented programming, and cloud syncing with Plastic SCM.

# Technologies Used

**Unity:** Game engine for collion detection, runtime rendering and physics.

**Plastic SCM:** For version control and cloud syncing, ensuring smooth collaboration within the team.

**OOP:** Used Object Oriented Programming structures to create the game logic.
