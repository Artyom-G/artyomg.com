# Overview

Ragdoll Smash is an expanded version of a game made during a 12-hour hackathon that I worked on with a partner. This version builds upon the original concept, providing a chaotic and entertaining experience where up to four local players control stickmen with ragdoll physics. The goal is simple: be the last player standing by knocking others off the platform.

# Gameplay

This game supports up to 4 players in local multiplayer, with the option to use controllers. Each player controls a stickman, using a unique set of controls to move, jump, and push opponents off the edge. The last player remaining on the platform wins.
