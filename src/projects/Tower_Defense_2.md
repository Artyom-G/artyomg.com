Lead a team of students to develop an isometric tower defense game built in Unity.

Welcome to Tower Defense 2, a thrilling 2D top-down pixel isometric tower defense.

Originally made in Unity, this project showcases my skills in game engines, object-oriented programming and cloud syncing with Plastic SCM.

The game features infinite waves on enemies that exponentially scale in difficulty. Do not let a single enemy through!
